# As everyone will have access to all designs, try to make it easy for someone new to your design to know what
# it does and how to operate it. This info will be automatically collected and used to make a datasheet for the chip.

# Here is a great example: https://github.com/davidsiaw/tt02-davidsiaw-stackcalc/blob/38c5647f83aad2aec675d566aa3d67b98f0aac81/info.yaml

  description:  "Count up to 10, one second at a time."

# Longer description of how the project works. You can use standard markdown format.
  how_it_works: |
      Uses a set of registers to divide the clock, and then some combinational logic
      to convert from binary to decimal for the display.

      Puts the bottom 8 bits of the counter on the bidirectional outputs.

# Instructions on how someone could test your project, include things like what buttons do what and how to set the clock if needed
  how_to_test:  |
      After reset, the counter should increase by one every second with a 10MHz input clock.

# A description of what the inputs do (e.g. red button, SPI CLK, SPI MOSI, etc).

# A description of what the bidirectional I/O pins do (e.g. I2C SDA, I2C SCL, etc)
